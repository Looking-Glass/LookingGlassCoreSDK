HoloPlay Core Example Project
===
This is an example project that shows how to use [HoloPlay Core](https://docs.lookingglassfactory.com/HoloPlayCore/) to build a crossplatform holographic renderer for a Looking Glass display. It is based on [OpenGL CMake Skeleton](https://github.com/ArthurSonzogni/OpenGL_CMake_Skeleton) by Arthur Sonzogni, and depends on [GLFW](https://github.com/glfw/glfw/), [GLEW](https://github.com/omniavinco/glew-cmake/), and [glm](https://github.com/g-truc/glm).

# Setup

## Clone with submodules

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Looking-Glass/HoloPlayCoreSDK.git
```

If you already have the repository and didn't use the `--recursive` option, you can type:
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Installing CMake and Dependencies

Follow [these instructions](https://cmake.org/install/) or use your preferred command-line package manager to download and install the latest version of CMake.  

If using a graphical installer on Windows or macOS, make sure to check "Add CMake to the system PATH".

[This document](https://cliutils.gitlab.io/modern-cmake/) has more helpful background on what CMake is and how to use it.

## Build

### Linux
First you will need to install the project dependencies:
```bash
sudo apt-get install cmake libxrandr-dev libxinerama-dev libxcursor-dev libxi-dev
```
Open the directory into a terminal:
```bash
cd ExampleProject
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
./main
```

### Windows
* Open the project with CMake GUI
* Configure (you have several options here depending on whether you wish to use the command line or an IDE for development)
* Generate
* Use IDE or command line to build
* Run the build (normally at `build\Debug\main.exe`)

Or, open the directory into a terminal:

```batchfile
cd ExampleProject
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
Debug\main.exe
```

### macOS
* Open the project with CMake GUI
* Configure (Xcode or "Unix Makefiles" both work fine)
* Generate
* Use IDE or command line to build
* Run the build (normally at `build/main`)

Or, open the directory into a terminal:
```bash
cd ExampleProject
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . 
./main
```
## Run

### Controls

 - **WASD** or mouse to move the camera
Scroll to zoom in and out

 - Press **SPACE** to show the quilt in debug mode (this displays a 2D quilt image)

 - Press **ESC** to quit


### Preview

![output](images/output.jpg)

### Troubleshooting

- If the content shows incorrectly compared to the preview:

    - Verify if the window is full-screen and borderless. Some graphics libraries may create windows with invisible decorations. If your hologram appears 'miscalibrated', you may wish to use a tool like [NirSoft WinLister](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/winlister.html) (Win32) or [xwininfo](https://linux.die.net/man/1/xwininfo) (Linux) to verify that your window has been opened with the correct properties. 

- If the app aborts or shuts down immediately:
  1. Verify that [HoloPlay Service](look.glass/holoplayservice) is installed and running. 
     - The HoloPlay Service icon should display in the taskbar, if running properly. 
     - If it is not installed, install it, and if it is not displaying in the taskbar, run it manually.
  2. Right-click on the taskbar icon. This opens a menu that shows information about all your connected Looking Glass displays. Make sure it detects at least one of your devices and its calibration. 
     -  If not, right-click on the icon to restart HoloPlay Service until it detects both the device and its calibration. Double check if your Looking Glass is plugged in a USB3.0 port. If you have any problems achieving this, please [email us](https://lookingglassfactory.com/contact) or report the bug in our [forum](https://forum.lookingglassfactory.com/?_ga=2.171851938.388081720.1583171731-2126388208.1558451460) or [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ZW87Y4m).

# Rendering Holograms with the Looking Glass

## Introduction
First, it may be helpful to know how the Looking Glass works. In order to display holograms, the Looking Glass takes **45 discrete views** of a 3D scene and presents them across a view cone roughly 40Â° wide.  

The simplest way to create these views is to render a 3D scene 45 times per frame, varying the camera position each time, then combine all views into a single texture called a **quilt**. In OpenGL, we save each view with a **framebuffer** and use a **blit shader** to copy it into its designated position in the quilt.

To show the views simultaneously, we use a **light field shader** to scramble the pixels in the quilt, making it appear as a 3D hologram when viewed through the Looking Glass.

Each Looking Glass display has a unique set of **calibration** values, which describe its optical properties. These are converted to **uniforms** (values passed from the CPU to the GPU at runtime) for the light field shader. Calibration values are read over USB by **HoloPlay Service** and could be accessed via HoloPlay Core. 

For the calibration to apply correctly, the rendering context must be perfectly aligned to the display. Your application can achieve this by creating a fullscreen, undecorated window. In this example we will use the GLFW library to create our window.

HoloPlay Core provides the source code for the light field shader as well as an interface to access the calibration values and exact window positions for each connected Looking Glass. 

This has been a brief overview of a complex process. For a more in-depth explanation of quilts, light fields, virtual camera setup, and the principles behind Looking Glass technology, please check out [More References](#more-references).


## Scripts

HoloPlayContext: a class that sets up the context for rendering holograms onto the Looking Glass.

SampleScene: inherits from HoloPlayContext. Overrides camera update, scene render and control functions in HoloPlayContext.

Shader class and helper scripts are included.


## Key Steps

Most key steps are implemented in `HoloPlayContext` and some could be overrided and implemented in `SampleScene`.

To recap, the key steps to display a hologram are:

#### Initialization &#8594; ``HoloPlayContext::HoloPlayContext()``

 1. Open connection to **HoloPlay Service**; retrieve window and calibration parameters &#8594; ``HoloPlayContext::HoloPlayContext()``
 2. Open a **full-screen window** on the Looking Glass &#8594; ``HoloPlayContext::openWindowOnLKG()``
 3. Compile **blit shaders** &#8594; ``HoloPlayContext::loadBlitShaders()``
 4. Create and configure **light field** shader:
       - Compile light field shader from provided GLSL &#8594; ``HoloPlayContext::loadLightFieldShaders()``
       - Request calibration &#8594; ``HoloPlayContext::loadLightFieldShaders()``
       - Configure **quilt settings** &#8594; ``HoloPlayContext::setupQuiltSettings()``
       - Pass them to the light field shader &#8594; ``HoloPlayContext::passQuiltSettingsToShader()``
 5. Allocate and configure quilt &#8594; ``HoloPlayContext::setupQuilt()``
 6. Allocate and configure **view texture** and **view framebuffer** targets &#8594; ``HoloPlayContext::setupViewTextureAndFrameBuffer()``
 
#### Rendering &#8594; ``HoloPlayContext::run()``

 1. Update scene logic (i.e., physics) &#8594; ``HoloPlayContext::update()``
 2. For each view in the quilt:
    1. Bind view framebuffer to view texture
    2. [Set up virtual camera](#set-up-virtual-camera--holoplaycontextsetupvirtualcameraforview) &#8594; ``HoloPlayContext::setupVirtualCameraForView()``
    3. Render the scene into the view framebuffer &#8594; ``HoloPlayContext::renderScene()``
        - This function should be overrided in child class. And in the override function, apply caculated view and projection of current view to the shader program that is used to render in child class &#8594;  `SampleScene::renderScene()`
    4. Use the blit shader to copy the view texture into the quilt texture &#8594; ``HoloPlayContext::copyViewToQuilt()``
```c++
void SampleScene::renderScene()
{
  ...
  shaderProgram->use();
  // holoplay special camera setup for each view, don't delete
  shaderProgram->setUniform("view", GetViewMatrixOfCurrentView());
  shaderProgram->setUniform("projection", GetProjectionMatrixOfCurrentView());
  ...
  shaderProgram->unuse();
}
``` 
 3. Draw the quilt: render the quilt texture to the default framebuffer using the light field shader ``HoloPlayContext::drawLightField()``

#### On Exit &#8594; ``HoloPlayContext::OnExit()``
 1. Free the ``HoloPlayContext`` objects created &#8594; `HoloPlayContext::release()`
 2. Release the connection to HoloPlay Service &#8594; `hpc_closeApp()`

## Set Up Virtual Camera 
&#8594; ``HoloPlayContext::setupVirtualCameraForView()``

 Here's an illustration of the way the camera position changes each frame:

![alt text][view-cone]

[view-cone]:https://docs.lookingglassfactory.com/HoloPlayCore/images/viewcone.png "camera moves on the red track"

The projection matrix also shifts between views. Here is an animation showing those changes: 
 ![alt text][quilt_format2]

[quilt_format2]:https://docs.lookingglassfactory.com/Appendix/images/multiplex.gif "quilt - top-down view of Looking Glass - single view"

So we calculate the position and projection offsets and then change the projection matrix:
```c++
void HoloPlayContext::setupVirtualCameraForView(int currentViewIndex,
                                                glm::mat4 currentViewMatrix)
{
  // The standard model Looking Glass screen is roughly 4.75" vertically. If we
  // assume the average viewing distance for a user sitting at their desk is
  // about 36", our field of view should be about 14Â°. There is no correct
  // answer, as it all depends on your expected user's distance from the Looking
  // Glass, but we've found the most success using this figure.
  const float fov = glm::radians(14.0f);
  float cameraDistance = -cameraSize / tan(fov / 2.0f);
  
  // start at -viewCone * 0.5 and go up to viewCone * 0.5
  float offsetAngle =
      (currentViewIndex / (qs_totalViews - 1.0f) - 0.5f) *
      glm::radians(viewCone); 

  float offset =
      cameraDistance *
      tan(offsetAngle); // calculate the offset that the camera should move

  // modify the view matrix (position)
  // determine the local direction of the offset using currentViewMatrix and translate
  glm::vec3 offsetLocal = glm::vec3(currentViewMatrix * glm::vec4(offset, 0.0f, cameraDistance, 1.0f));
  viewMatrix = glm::translate(currentViewMatrix, offsetLocal);

  float aspectRatio = getWindowRatio();

  projectionMatrix = glm::perspective(fov, aspectRatio, 0.1f, 100.0f);
  // modify the projection matrix, relative to the camera size and aspect ratio
  projectionMatrix[2][0] += offset / (cameraSize * aspectRatio);
}
```

# Project Structure
When starting a new project, you can use this example project as a template.  Begin by rendering your own scene in `SampleScene::renderScene`, then change how the camera updates in `SampleScene::GetCurrentViewMatrix` and reimplement control functions for customization. Here is a list of all the virtual functions in the `SampleScene` class:
 ```c++
  virtual void update(); // update each frame
  virtual void onExit(); // release memory here
  virtual void renderScene(); // render scene, will render 45 timers per frame for 45 views
  virtual glm::mat4
      getViewMatrixOfCurrentFrame();  // define how view matrix gets updated each frame here.
                               // projection matrix is not changeable because
                               // the field of view is static according to hardware measurement
  virtual bool processInput(GLFWwindow* window);  // all key inputs
  virtual void mouse_callback(GLFWwindow* window, double xpos, double ypos);
  virtual void scroll_callback(GLFWwindow* window,
                               double xoffset,
                               double yoffset);
 ```

If you have an existing 3D app and you want to bring it in the Looking Glass, please refer to how the HoloPlay Context is [initialized](#initialization--holoplaycontextholoplaycontext) and [released](#on-exit--holoplaycontextonexit), [how the camera changes for 45 views](#set-up-virtual-camera--holoplaycontextsetupvirtualcameraforview), and [how to copy views to the quilt](#rendering--holoplaycontextrun) in the example project. Then, build up the same context in your project. We recommend reading the section below for more detailed instructions.
